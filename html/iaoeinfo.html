            The Institute of Age of Empires (IAoE) is a hobby project of mine that I, Batuhan ÖZ, code along to my WebDev journey.<br>
            I aim to mix my passion for Age of Empires and my interest in Web Development by creating engaging content and tools for fans of the game.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            The IAoE is a platform where players can find information about the game, including guides, strategies, and resources to enhance their gameplay experience.<br>
            The website is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, making it easy for players of all skill levels to navigate and find the information they need.<br>
            I aim to create tools that will help players improve their skills and knowledge of the game, such as calculators for unit stats, build orders, and other useful resources.<br>
            Gain the bleeding-edge in-game knowledge by being a student of IAoE. Improve your gameplay today!<br>
